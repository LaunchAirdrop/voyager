- **Rate Limiting**: The bot includes delays between requests to avoid rate limiting.
- **Daily Reset**: The bot automatically waits for the next daily reset (00:00 UTC).
- **Proxy Testing**: All proxies are tested before use. Only working proxies are utilized.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use Dedicated Wallets**: Create separate wallets specifically for this bot.
2. **Limited Funds**: Only keep minimal funds needed for transactions.
3. **Secure Environment**: Run the bot on a secure server or local machine.
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep the bot updated with the latest version.

### Common Issues

**"No private keys found"**
- Make sure your `.env` file exists and contains `PRIVATE_KEY_1=...` format

**"Proxy connection failed"**
- Verify your proxy credentials and format in `proxies.txt`
- The bot will work without proxies if none are available

**"Authentication failed"**
- Check if your private key is valid
- Ensure your wallet has some ETH for gas fees

**"Rate limit reached"**
- The bot includes automatic delays, but you can increase them if needed
- Consider using fewer wallets or longer delays
